# trek-family-parse

This project was created in a volunteer effort for a youth event that a local church was holding.

This script assumes that you have all of the youth attending trek in a csv with 4 headers: 'Gender', 'Age', 'Name', 'Ward'. It will then loop through each
row and assign it to a family. Families are hard coded into the script in a list. The youth will be evenly distributed across families with each family
containing a range of youth for each age and evenly distributed between male and female students.
